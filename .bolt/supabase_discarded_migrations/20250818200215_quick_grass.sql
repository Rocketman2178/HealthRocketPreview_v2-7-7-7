  # Fix Community RLS Infinite Recursion

  This migration completely resolves the infinite recursion issue in community_memberships
  by temporarily disabling RLS and creating a simple, non-recursive policy structure.

  ## Changes Made
  1. Disable RLS on community_memberships temporarily
  2. Drop all existing problematic policies
  3. Create simple, direct policies without circular references
  4. Re-enable RLS with safe policies
